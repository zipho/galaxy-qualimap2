long_description: |
   Qualimap examines sequencing alignment data in SAM/BAM files according to the features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the data that helps to the detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of the data and eases decision-making for further analysis.
   this version of the tool aims to produce outputs that are compatible with MultiQC: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/blob/master/docs/modules/qualimap.md
